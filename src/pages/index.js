      I took a step back from this project because I wasn't feeling inspired. I
      was <em>just</em> a bit late in creating this podcast, since it would have
      gone well with my search for more technical depth. I'm still searching,
      but I'm also interested in things like growing my business and writing a
      bunch of Clojure... anyway, feel free to message me on Twitter:{" "}
